# AI Job Application Tracker

A full-stack portfolio project built for software engineering and product-minded roles. It combines a visually attractive React frontend with a FastAPI backend, SQLite persistence, analytics, and differentiated features designed to make job applying feel motivating instead of draining.

## Why this project stands out

Most job trackers stop at CRUD. This one adds product thinking and behavioral design:

- **Momentum Engine**: tracks weekly application progress, streaks, confidence, and active pipeline health
- **Ghost Risk Detector**: flags applications that likely need a follow-up now
- **Skill Gap Mirror**: compares pasted job descriptions against the user's skills to show fit score, matched skills, and missing skills
- **Energy Window Planner**: recommends the best time block for focused job applications based on the user's preferred energy window
- **Wins Wall**: keeps emotional momentum high with confidence-building progress messages

## Run locally

### 1. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Start the frontend

Open a second terminal:
